## Hey, I'm Justyn!

I'm a software engineer at [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg/). I build tech for public good.

### About

I'm a full-stack engineer with experience in building frontend, backend and infrastructure for web applications. Though I write code for a living, I enjoy theory a lot over a range of domains in math and computer science, including algorithms, complexity theory, cryptography, distributed systems, and programming languages, just to name a few.

Outside of work, you might find me facing walls at the climbing gym, playing board games with friends, or cafe-hopping around Singapore!

### Skills

I've worked extensively with:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Git
- OCaml

I'm somewhat familiar with:

- NestJS
- PostgreSQL
- Python
- Haskell
