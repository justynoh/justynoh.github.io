I've migrated my personal website from WordPress to Jekyll, which is now hosted on GitHub Pages. This allows for easier maintenance and version control of my website content.

The new site maintains all the content from my previous website while improving performance and simplifying the publishing workflow.

Feel free to explore the [projects](/projects/) section to see some of my work!
